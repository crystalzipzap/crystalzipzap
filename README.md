### Hi, I am Crystal, a full-stack developer ðŸ‘‹

I am a former tax accountant who survived Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and then went back to my alma mater for a Master's in Computer Science. And since then, I have been feeling like a fish back to the sea. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Google Keep clone, collabrating on an Art Management System, and building up my confidence to contribute to open-source projects xD
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PERN Stack, TypeScript, ASP.NET, and Golang
- ðŸ“š I'm trying to figure out project ideas involving accounting domain knowledge
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me a LinkedIn Request and let's get the DM going
- âš¡ Fun fact: I tore my right knee ACL from playing Dance Dance Revolution
