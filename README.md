### Hi, I am Crystal, a full-stack developer 👋

I am a former tax accountant who survived Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and then went back to my alma mater for a Master's in Computer Science. And since then, I have been feeling like a fish back to the sea. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Google Keep clone, collabrating on an Art Management System, and building up my confidence to contribute to open-source projects xD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PERN Stack, TypeScript, ASP.NET, and Golang
- 📚 I'm trying to figure out project ideas involving accounting domain knowledge
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a LinkedIn Request and let's get the DM going
- ⚡ Fun fact: I tore my right knee ACL from playing Dance Dance Revolution in 2023

### I would not have been where I am today without these creators' content on YouTube:
- [Coding In Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow) - Florian covers MERN Stack, Next.js, Good practice, and so much more. Florian uses TypeScript, and Florian loves Express Sessions as much as his dry humors.
- [Frank Liu](https://www.youtube.com/@FrankLiuSoftware/) - Frank posts great code-along ASP.NET projects. He is straightforward, knowledgeable, and very efficient. 
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin is our CSS dad. Kevin is a CSS magician.
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) - Kyle was the first creator I checked out for React Tutorial. His barebone To-do list was my first introduction to useState(). Kyle covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to, React, TypeScript, Web Dev, and more.
